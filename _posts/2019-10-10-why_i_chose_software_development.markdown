Choosing software development was a pretty easy choice for me, believe it or not. 

I grew up with a Dad who has been in development since I was a little one. It has always been something that has been in the corner of my eye, but I finally decided to take the next steps and join a program that could actually help me reach the goals I had in mind. After a few years of trying the self taught route I found myself floundering out in certain stages of my journey, whether that be getting stuck and not being able to find the resources to move forward or just life happening and losing track of what I was doing, I couldn't stay on track. This is when I started looking into the different programs available that could take me to the next level. This is when I found Flatiron School and made the decision to join the program and commit myself to the journey that I am now on. Flatiron has been a guiding force for me that has helped me learn more than I have ever before and all in a much shorter period of time. I can't wait to continue on this journey and see how far I can grow my knowledge and my career.
