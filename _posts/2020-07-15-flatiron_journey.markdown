It's finally that time.  I have been participating in a Flatiron Bootcamp for Web Development for that last 10 months and I have finally passed my final project review. This hasn't been easy though and I want this to serve as a warning for anyone else who decides to take the same journey I did. This isn't a bad warning, but a warning of the work that that is in front of you.

When I started I really wanted to do the intensive course but with a lot of things in life, you don't always get what you want. I needed to work a full time job to support myself so that put me on the path of the part time course that would take 10 months. I was eager and excited to get started and was well aware of the financial burden I had taken on but also aware of the path that I was forging for myself. 

Being aware of your time and making plans is probably the most important facet of being successful in this program. While in the intensive program it allows you to focus solely on coding, but the part time program allows you to keep you normal life and supplement it with learning something that will lead you too a new career path. Learning to balance that learning with your daily life will allow you to be succesful, not without hard work though. I worked a 40 hour a week job and also had to find someway to do 20-25 hours of work a week on top of that. It makes it much easier knowing what youre doing is going to change your life.

The real reminder I want to leave you with is that while it may get hard down the road, just remember to keep on pushing yourself. The feeling you have upon completion is like no other, but remeber the work never stops even after you are done. This is when the real work begins and you start looking for a job and figurinng out what it is you want to do and how you want to utilize what you have been learning for the past 10 months. To anyone who wants to go on this journey, I wish you luck and just know even if you find yourself in the middle of the program feeling defeated at some points, just remeber to keep pushing and the ultimate reward will be worth the hard work and sacrifice you are making right now.
